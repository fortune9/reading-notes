## Paper

- title: Plasma cell-free RNA profiling distinguishes cancers from
  pre-malignant conditions in solid and hematologic malignancies
- link: <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-022-00270-y>

## Notes

### Sample summary

plasma samples of eight hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and ten multiple
myeloma (MM) patients, 12 patients of their respective precancerous
conditions, and 20 non-cancer (NC) donors

### Main findings

- built classification models using Random Forest and linear
  discriminant analysis algorithms that could distinguish cancer
  patients from premalignant conditions and NC individuals with high
  accuracy

- Plasma cfRNA biomarkers of HCC are liver-specific genes and biomarkers
  of MM are highly expressed in the bone marrow compared to other
  tissues and are related to cell cycle processes.

- cfRNA biomarkers were validated in an independent sample set (20 HCC,
  9 MM, and 10 NC) with AUC greater than 0.86
