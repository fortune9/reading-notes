## Notes

### Main ideas

-   Two methods are currently preferred for measurable residual disease
    (MRD) evaluation in many centers: multiparameter flow cytometry and
    real-time quantitative PCR

-   Additional methods such as next-generation sequencing and digital
    PCR are under investigation, in an attempt to increase the
    sensitivity and thus allowing the detection of small clones

-   MRD positivity after chemotherapy is associated with negative
    prognosis, and the reappearance of MRD during follow-up allows
    impending relapse to be identified and consequently enables early
    intervention

-   Frequently, a founding clone can be identified at diagnosis and
    additional small subclones can be detected only by very sensitive
    methods

-   MRD indicates the presence of leukemia cells down to the levels of
    1:10^4 to 1:10^6 white blood cells, compared with 1:20 in
    morphology-based measurement

-   Real-time PCR represents, so far, the gold standard for MRD
    detection

-   Marker for molecular MRD:

    -   Fusion transcript in core binding factor (CBF): CBFB-MYH11 and
        RUNX1-RUNX1T1
    -   NPM1 mutation
    -   PML-RARA
    -   The Wilmsâ€™ tumor gene (WT1) overexpression
    -   IDH1/IDH2 mutations

-   Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC): based on a panel of antibodies
    targeting early markers such as CD34 and CD117, markers of
    myeloid-lineage such as CD33, and myeloid differentiation antigens
    like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15 or lymphoid antigens including CD2,
    CD7, CD19, or CD56

-   New techniques are on the horizon for the detection of small
    leukemic clones. A promising approach is based on digital PCR. It is
    estimated that ddPCR can detect up to 0.001% mutated allele
    frequency

-   Next-generation sequencing: Since there is a high degree of
    genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in AML, each patient should
    have a unique signature to be used to track MRD after therapy. The
    main disadvantages of using NGS are shorter read length and the fact
    that its ability to detect MRD depends on the depth of sequencing
    and on the type of computational algorithms used.
