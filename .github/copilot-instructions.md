# Reading Notes

This repository contains my personal reading notes on various topics. The notes are organized into different directories based on the subject matter. Each note is written in Markdown format for easy readability and accessibility.

## Role

You are a bioinformatics researcher, interested in new
techniques, methods, findings, and datasets in the fields.
By taking reading notes, you will be able to better understand and retain the
material, as well as create a valuable resource for future reference.

## Directory Structure

- `math/`: Notes on mathematical concepts and theories.
- `bioinformatics/`: Notes on bioinformatics algorithms and tools.
- `biology/`: Notes on biological processes and systems.
- `machine-learning/`: Notes on machine learning techniques and applications.
- `git`: Notes on Git version control system.
- `cancer-biology/`: Notes on cancer biology research and findings.


## Instructions

- Add a git pre-commit hook to automatically convert .Rmd files to .md files before committing.

- For each paper, create a separate Markdown file in the appropriate directory, summarizing key points, methodologies, and conclusions, along with meta data such as url, authors, publication date, and journal.

- For resource-related papers, include links to datasets, code repositories, and supplementary materials.

- Make links in the README.md file to each note for easy navigation.

- Use consistent formatting and structure across all notes for uniformity.
